# Social Distancing Violation Monitoring using YOLOv3 | Convolutional Neural Network | OpenCV

## Description

Welcome to our projects ‚Äì Social Distancing using YOLOv3 and OpenCV. In this project, we aim to monitor and assess whether social distancing guidelines are being adhered to in a specific locality.

In this project, we'll delve into the realm of tracking social distance infractions in public places using the cutting-edge object identification technology YOLOv3. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of social isolation in maintaining public safety and health.

We'll provide step-by-step guidance on leveraging YOLOv3 for real-time people detection and tracking, distance estimation, and identification of potential social distancing rule violations. Additionally, we'll demonstrate how to create visualizations and alerts for surveillance and enforcement of social distance regulations using the output from YOLOv3.

This project is a valuable resource for computer vision engineers, data scientists, and anyone interested in applying machine learning and computer vision to address public health challenges. 
**NOTE:** Although the optimal approach involves using 3D projections for enhanced predictions, for the sake of simplicity, we have utilized Euclidean distance in this project.
